## GNR638: ML4RS - Fall 2019 - IIT Bombay

## Introduction

Remote sensing satellite constellations image our entire planet every day and generate massive amounts of data. With growing data volumes, it is becoming impossible for humans to process and extract useful information from it. Machine learning can help us do this with the help of computers. In this assignment, we will detect the contents of a satellite image.

## Problem Statement

This competition involves a remote sensing image classification problem. Given an image you are required to design a neural network based classfier to identify the contents of the image sample. A data sample can belong to three classes namely; An aircraft, A ship or Neither.

## Deliverables

Submit a .csv file containing the predictions made by your model for the test samples provided. Example(round off your answer to nearest integer).
Below is a sample of the first few lines of submission file. Your submissions should be named "rollNumber.csv" and should look like)

imageId,label

0,2
1,1
2,2
3,0
4,1

## Programming Language and Framework

PyTorch/Tensorflow/Keras will be allowed to maintain uniformity but no other framework. Programming should be done in Python language.

## Important Note

Credits: This is a private competition for now.
